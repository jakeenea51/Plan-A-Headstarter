## Download
```
git clone https://github.com/jakeenea51/Plan-A-Headstarter.git
```

## Install requirements
```
npm install
```

## Connect to APIs
To connect to your database, create a firebase project and insert the configuration information into the ```src/services/firebase.js``` file.

To connect to the video calling service, create an Agora project and insert the App ID and a temporary meeting token into the ```src/services/settings.js``` and ```src/pages/components/VideoRoom.js``` files.

## Start server
```
npm start
```

## Host server to public URL using ngrok
Create ngrok account and download ngrok zip folder ([here](https://ngrok.com/download)). Enter ngrok directory in terminal and run the following commands:
```
ngrok config add-authtoken <ngrok auth token>
ngrok http 3000
```

## Add users to groups
Adding users to groups is done manually through the firestore database. To add a user to a group create the following collections:
1. Name the first collection the same as the user's UID (found in the authentication section of your firebase project).
2. Add a new document to this collection titled groupInfo, and add two fields:
- group = {group1, group2, etc...}
- backColor = {hex color code}
3. If not already created, name the second collection the same as the group name assigned in the previous step.
